# tefler
A textual feature modeling tool based on Xtext.

Tefler is a textual feature (an essential concept in software product lines) modeling tool based on Xtext. Tefler supports feature
attributes, complex composition rules, as well as cardinality support for both standalone (individual) and feature groups. In addition,
tefler supports modularity via import for large feature models.

However, the current version of tefler does not support more for validation (mainly naming and types) and context assistant except
for the basic Xtext provides based on the grammar that tefler supports. These feature may be included in future versions. 

You can install tefler via Eclipse update manager (site: https://github.com/zhou-jg/tefler/deploy). After installation, you can 
create feature files with extension .fm thereby activating tefler editors. The grammar (in EBNF) can be found at  https://github.com/zhou-jg/tefler/deploy/TEFL_grammar.txt.

Hoping it helps to you!
